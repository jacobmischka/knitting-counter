# Knitting counter

![Hello, arduino!](hello-arduino.jpg)

I made this simple knitting / T-counter using an Arduino Uno for my mother for Christmas.
My first small hardware/microcontroller project, in Rust!

I'm pleased with the overall design and software, though the physical assembly could definitely be improved.
I was cutting it close on time and the pandemic made it difficult to get materials.
